# Probability Measure

## Definition

The requirements for a function $P$ to be a probability measure on a [[Permanent/Probability Space|probability space]] are that:

- $P$ must return results in the [unit interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_interval "Unit interval") ${\displaystyle [0,1]}$ returning 0 for the empty set and 1 for the entire space.
- $P$ must satisfy the _countable additivity_ property that for all [countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable "Countable") collections $\{E_{i}\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ of pairwise [disjoint sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets "Disjoint sets"):

  $${\displaystyle P \left(\bigcup _{i\in\mathbb{N}}E_{i}\right)=\sum _{i\in\mathbb{N}}P (E_{i}).}$$
