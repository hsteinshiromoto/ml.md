A common used is the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test with performs a test in a [[J. Brownlee - Machine Learning Mastery]] form:

In this test, the null hypothesis states that $\phi=1$ (a unit test). If $p-$value is low $<0.05$ we reject the null hypothesis, i.e, **we assume that the dataset is [[stationary]]**. Else, we accept the null hypothesis.
