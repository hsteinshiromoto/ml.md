* Import `arima_model` from `statsmodels`
* Use `pmdarima` to run crossvaliation

Delevop model using the following steps:
1. Run an [[stationary test|augmented Dickey-Fuller]] test
2. Run `autoarima` to select the what model to use (i.e. order of each ARIMA terms)
3. Train the model
4. Call `model.summary()` to check for training summary
5. Forecast into the future
	1. Here recall that the model will predict well the mean but not the noise
