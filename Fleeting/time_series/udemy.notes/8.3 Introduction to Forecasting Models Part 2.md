Use sklearn's [[Mean Squared Error]] and [[Mean Absolute Error]].

Compare square root of the MSE with the std of the data set

A time series is said to be stationary if it does not exhibit trends or seasonality.

A nonstationary time series can be made stationary, by using differencing:
`from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.tools import diff`

We plot the differenced and check if it is stationary
