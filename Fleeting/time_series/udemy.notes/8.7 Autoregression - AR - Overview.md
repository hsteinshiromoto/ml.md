We forecast using a linear combination of past values of the variable. In other words, it is a linear regression where the predictors are the previous observations

The term [[autoregression]] describes a regression of the variable against itself. An [[autoregression]] is run against a set of lagged values of order $p$.

Let $c$ be a constant, $\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_p$ be lag coefficients and $\epsilon_t$ be a white noise. The AR model is given by

$$y(t)=c+\phi_1y(t-1)+\cdots+\phi_p y(t-p)+\epsilon_t\;.$$

The simplest model is the AR(1):
$$y(t)=c+\phi_1y(t-1)+\epsilon_t\;.$$
