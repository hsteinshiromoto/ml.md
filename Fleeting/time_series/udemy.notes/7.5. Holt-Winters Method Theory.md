Comprises a forecast equation and three smoothing equations

The smoothin equation are:
	* $\ell(t)$ level using smoothing parameter $\alpha$
	* $b(t)$ trend using smoothing parameter $\beta$
	* $s(t)$ seasonal using smoothing parameter $\gamma$
	
The seasonal component present two variations:
	* Additive method: when seasonal variation is constant through the series
	* Multiplicative method: when seasonal variation are changing proportionally to the level of the series
	
Single Exponential Smoothing (similar to [[7.3. EWMA Theory]])
$$\begin{eqnarray}
y(0)&=&x(0)\\
y(t)&=&(1-\alpha)y(t-1)+\alpha x(t)
\end{eqnarray}$$

Double Exponential Smoothing (Holt's method):
$$\begin{eqnarray}
l(t)&=&(1-\alpha)l(t-1)+\alpha x(t)\\
b(t)&=&(1-\beta)b(t-1)+\beta (l(t)-l(t-1))\\
y(t)&=&l(t) + b(t)\\
\hat{y}(t+h)&=&l(t)+hb(t)\;,
\end{eqnarray}$$
where $y$ is the fitted model and $\hat{y}$ is the forecasting model with $h$ periods in the future. Can predict general level and trend, but not seasonality.

Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holts-Winters' method):
$$\begin{eqnarray}
l(t)&=&(1-\alpha)l(t-1)+\alpha x(t)\\
b(t)&=&(1-\beta)b(t-1)+\beta (l(t)-l(t-1))\\
c(t)&=&(1-\gamma)c(t-L)+\gamma (x(t)-l(t-1)-b(t-1))\\
y(t)&=&(l(t) + b(t))c(t)\\
\hat{y}(t+h)&=&(l(t)+mb(t))c(t-L+1+(m-1)\mod L)\;,
\end{eqnarray}$$
where $c$ is seasonality component, $y$ is the fitted model and $\hat{y}$ is the forecasting model with $h$ periods in the future, $L$ is divisions per cycle (e.g. in a year data, $L=12$ months).
