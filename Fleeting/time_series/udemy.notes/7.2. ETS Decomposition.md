ETS Models: Error-Trend-Seasonality
* Exponential smoothing
* Trend Methods Models
* ETS Decomposition


`statsmodels` provides a seasonal decomposition tool we can use to separate out the different components (e.g. [[7.1. Introduction to Statsmodels Library]])

ETS Models will take each components for smoothing by combining these components

Types of models:
	* Additive: when it seems that the trend is linear and the seasonality and trend components seems to be constante over time
	* Multiplicative: increasing or decreasing at a nonlinear rate
