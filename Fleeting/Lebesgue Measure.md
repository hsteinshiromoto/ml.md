# Lebesgue Measure

## Statements

**Definition**. ([[Salsa S. - Partial Differential Equations in Action|@Sal08, Theorem B.1]]). Let $(X,\mathfrak{B}$) be a [[Sigma Algebra|measurable space]], where $\mathfrak{B}$ is a [[Borel Sigma Algebra|Borel sigma algebra]]. The [[Abstract Measure|measure]] $\mu:X\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$ is said to be a _Lebesgue measure_ if
1. Every [[Open Set|open set]] and [[Closed Set|closed set]] belong to $\mathfrak{B}$.
2. If $A\in\mathfrak{B}$ and $\mu(A)=0$, then every subset of $A$ belongs to $\mathfrak{B}$ also has also measure zero.
3. ...
