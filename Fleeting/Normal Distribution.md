# Normal Distribution

## Statements

**Definition**. Let $X$ be a [[random variable]] with outcome set $\mathbb{R}$ and [[Probability Density Function|PDF]] $$f(x)=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma}}\exp\left(-\dfrac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right),$$ Then $X$ is called a _Gaussian random variable_ and said to be distributed according to a _Gaussian distribution_ with parameters $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\sigma^2 > 0$, for which we write $X \sim \mathcal{N} (\mu, \sigma^2)$. These parameters are the [[Expected Value|expectation]] and [[Variance and Standard Deviation|standard deviation]], respectively.

The normal [[Probability Distribution|distribution]] is said to be a _standard normal_ [[Probability Distribution|distribution]], when $\sigma=1$ and $\mu=0$.

## Plot

For the normal [[Probability Distribution|distribution]], the values less than one [[Variance and Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] away from the [[Expected Value|mean]] account for 68.27% of the set; while two [[Variance and Standard Deviation|standard deviations]] from the [[Expected Value|sample mean]] account for 95.45%; and three [[Variance and Standard Deviation|standard deviations]] account for 99.73%.
