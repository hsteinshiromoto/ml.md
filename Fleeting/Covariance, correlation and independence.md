# Covariance, Correlation and Independence

## Theorem

([@][[D. Ostwald - The general linear model 20_21|Ost20]] Theorem 6.4.2.) Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be [[Random Variable|random variables]] with [[Covariance of Random Variables|covariance]] $\text{cov}(X_1,X_2)$ and [[Correlation of Random Variables|correlation]] $\text{corr}(X_1,X_2)$. If $X_1$ and $X_2$ are [[independent random variables]], then $\text{cov}(X_1,X_2)=0$ and $X_1$ and $X_2$ are [[Correlation of Random Variables|uncorrelated]]. Conversely, if $\text{cov}(X_1,X_2)=0$ and hence $X_1$ and $X_1$ are [[Correlation of Random Variables|uncorrelated]], then $X_1$ and $X_1$ are not necessarily [[Independent Random Variables|independent]].
