# Covariance of Random Variables

## Definition

([@][[D. Ostwald - The general linear model 20_21|Ost20]] Definition 6.4.1.) The _covariance_ of two [[Random Variable|random variables]] $X_1$ and $X_2$ with finite [[Expected Value of a Random Variable|expectations]] is defined as

$$\text{cov}(X_{1},X_2)= E ((X_1 − E(X_1))(X_2 − E(X_2)))$$
