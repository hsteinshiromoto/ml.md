# Relationship Between Bernoulli and Binomial Distributions

## Theorem

Let $X$ be a [[Permanent/Binomial Distribution|Binomial-distributed random variable]] with success proportion $x$ and number of Bernoulli trials $n$. Then, if $n=1$, the random variable $X$ is [[Bernoulli Distribution|Bernoulli distributed]].
