# Sample Variance and Sample Standard Deviation

([@[[D. Ostwald - The general linear model 20_21|Ost20]]], Definition 6.3.1) Let $(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ be [[Random Variable|random variables]] and let $\bar{X}$ be their [[sample mean]]. Then the _sample variance_ of $(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ is defined as

$$S^2(X)=\dfrac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(\bar{X}-X_i)^2\;.$$

The _sample standard deviation_ is defined as

$$S(X)=\sqrt{S^2(X)}\;.$$
