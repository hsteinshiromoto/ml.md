# Variance and Standard Deviation of a Random Variable

## Definition

([@Ost20] Definition 6.2.1.) Let $X$ be a [[random variable]] with [[Expected Value of a Random Variable|expectation]] $E(X)$. The _variance_ $X$ is defined as

$$V(X)=E((X-E(X))^2)$$

assuming that this [[Expected Value of a Random Variable|expectation]] exists. The _standard deviation_ of a [[random variable]] is defined as the square root of the variance of a [[random variable]],

$$S(X)=\sqrt{V(X)}.$$
