# Log-Normal Distribution

## Definition

Let $Z$ be a [[Normal Distribution|standard normal distributed random variable]], let $\mu$ be the [[sample mean]] and $\sigma>0$ be the sample [[Sample Variance and Sample Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] the [[Probability Density Function|PDF]] defined as

$$X=e^{\mu+\sigma Z}$$

is called the _log-normal distribution_ with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$.
