# Poisson as the Limit of Binomial Distribution

## Theorem

Let $X$ be a [[Binomial Distribution|binomial distributed random variable]] with success rate $p$ in $n$ trials. If $n>20$ is and $p<0.05$ remains fixed, then $X$ is a [[Poisson Distribution|Poisson distributed random variable]] with rate $\lambda=np$.
