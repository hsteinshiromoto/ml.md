# Correlation of Random Variables

## Definition

([@][[D. Ostwald - The general linear model 20_21|Ost20]] Definition 6.4.1.) Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be [[Random Variable|random variables]] with [[Covariance of Random Variables|covariance]] $\text{cov}(X_1,X_2)$ the _correlation_ of these variables is defined as

$$\text{corr}(X_{1},X_2)=\dfrac{\text{cov}(X_{1},X_2)}{S(X_1)S(X_2)}\;,$$

where $S(\cdot)$ is the [[Variance and Standard Deviation of a Random Variable|standard deviation]].
