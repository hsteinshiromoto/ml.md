# Multiplication Of 1-Forms

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $\omega$ and $\nu$ be [[1-form]]s, and vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$, the operation 
$$ \omega\wedge\nu(v_1,v_2)=\begin{vmatrix}\omega(v_1)&\nu(v_1)\\
\omega(v_2)&\nu(v_2)\end{vmatrix}$$
is said to be a *multiplication* of the 1-forms $\omega$ and $\nu$.
