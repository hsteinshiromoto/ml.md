An autocorrelation plot (aka correlogram) shows the correlation of the series with itself, lagged by $x$ time units.

The $y-$axis is the correlation and $x-$axis is the number of time units of lag.

Example. If a time series containing the daily number of sales is given. The autocorrelation will answer the question: "How correlated are today's sales to yesterday's sales?"

Look at the correlation for 1 shift
