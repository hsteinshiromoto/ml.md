Naive Bayes classifiers is used in [[classification]] based on applying [[Bayes' theorem]] with strong (na√Øve) independence assumptions between the features. They are among the simplest Bayesian network models.

The corresponding classifier, is the function that assigns a class label $\hat{y} = C_k$ for some $k$ as follow
$$\hat{y}=\arg\max_{k\in \{1,\ldots,K\}}p(C_k)\prod_{i=1}^np(x_i|C_k)$$
