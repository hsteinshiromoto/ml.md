Let $X$ and $Y$ be two jointly distributed [[random variable|random variables]], the covariacne is defined as the [[Expected Value of a Random Variable]] of the product of their deviations from their indivicual expected values
$$\text{cov}(X,Y)=\text{E}[(X-\text{E}[X])(Y-\text{E}[Y])]\;.$$

N.B. 1. The covariance of a variable with itself is equls to its [[variance]] $\text{cov}(X,X)=\text{var}(X)$.

N.B. 2. Covariance and [[correlation]] are similar. In fact, [[correlation]] is covariance normalized by the product of the individual [[standard deviation]] of the random variables:
$$\text{corr}(X,Y)=\dfrac{\text{cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}\;.$$
