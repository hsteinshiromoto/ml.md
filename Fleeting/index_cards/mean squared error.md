Let $n$ be the total number of observations, $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1, n]}$ an index  and $y_i$ be the $i-$th observation. The *mean squared error* is given by
$$\text{MSE}=\dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2\;.$$

The mean squarred error is related to [[residual sum of squares]] (RSS) by the equation
$$\text{MSE}=\dfrac{\text{RSS}}{n}\;.$$
