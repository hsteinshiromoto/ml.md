# T Distribution Theorem

## Theorem

([@[[D. Ostwald - The general linear model 20_21|Ost20]]], Theorem 7.5.1) Let $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$$ be [[Normal Distribution|standard normal random variable]], let $V \sim \chi^2(n)$ be a [[Chi-Squared Distribution|chi-square distribution]] with $n$ degrees of freedom, and assume that $Z$ and $V$ are [[Independent Random Variables|independence]]. Then the [[random variable]] $$T=\dfrac{Z}{\sqrt{V/n}}$$is a [[t Distribution|t random variable]] with n degrees of freedom.
