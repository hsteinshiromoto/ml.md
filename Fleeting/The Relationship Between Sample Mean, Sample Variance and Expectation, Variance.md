# The Relationship Between Sample Mean, Sample Variance and Expectation, Variance

([@[[D. Ostwald - The general linear model 20_21|Ost20]]], Section 6.3.) The theoretical constructs of [[Expected Value of a Random Variable|expectations]], [[Variance and Standard Deviation of a Random Variable|variances]], and [[Variance and Standard Deviation of a Random Variable|standard deviations]] should not be confused with the concepts of [[Sample Mean|sample means]], [[Sample Variance and Sample Standard Deviation|sample variances]], and [[Sample Variance and Sample Standard Deviation|sample standard deviations]]. The former entities are of theoretical nature and can be evaluated once the [[Probability Distribution|distributions]] of [[Random Variable|random variables]] have been specified. The latter entities are of practical nature, can be evaluated numerically based on observed data, and serve as estimators of the former theoretical quantities
