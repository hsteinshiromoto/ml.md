## What Are Fleeting Notes?

The idea behind fleeting notes is that they are written to capture every idea that pops into your mind. Don’t worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on. These are fleeting notes, mere reminders of what is in your head. They should not cause any distraction. Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later. [1]

The promise of processing your literature notes is that when you write down your thoughts, you are thinking for yourself, thinking through your writing, and improving your understanding of the topic. This act of processing your fleeting notes is when you start to generate even more new ideas and connect existing ideas to new ones.

Writing your fleeting thoughts is critical, as our memories suffer from the entropy of time. Writing it down not only helps with thinking but makes it permanent. By taking these notes, you can refresh your memory when you need context about why a sentence resonates with you and what you were thinking at that time. [2]
