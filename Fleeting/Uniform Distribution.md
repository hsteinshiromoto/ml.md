# Uniform Distribution

## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[random variable]] with outcome set $\mathbb{R}$ and [[Probability Density Function|PDF]] defined as

$$f(x)={\begin{cases}{\frac {1}{b-a}}&\mathrm {for} \ a\leq x\leq b,\\[8pt]0&\mathrm {for} \ x<a\ \mathrm {or} \ x>b\end{cases}}$$

is said to be a _uniformly distributed random variable_.
