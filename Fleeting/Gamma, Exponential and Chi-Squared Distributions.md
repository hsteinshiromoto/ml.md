# Gamma, Exponential and Chi-Squared Distributions

The [[Gamma distribution]] family comprises two important special cases: for an integer $n$, the [[Gamma distribution]] with $\alpha = n/2$ and $\beta = 2$ corresponds to the [[Chi-Squared Distribution|chi-square distribution]], while the [[Gamma distribution]] with $\alpha=1$ and $\beta>0$ is known as the [[exponential distribution]].
