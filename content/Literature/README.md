## What Are Literature Notes?

Literature notes are the ideas of the author, explained in your own words. The clue here is that both you and the author must come together to create this note. This is where writing and processing fleeting notes become helpful, as the fleeting notes are where you expand on your ideas. Briefly review your literature note, check the reference notes, and ask yourself: How can I write the argument the author is conveying in my own words?

It's essential to use your own words, as doing so ensures you genuinely understand it. You only understand something fully if you can explain it to yourself.

Literature notes are not paraphrasing the author in your own words.
