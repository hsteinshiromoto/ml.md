# Tangent Vectors as Derivations

## Statements

**Theorem**. The mapping between the [[Euclidean Tangent Space]] at $p$ and the set of all [[Derivation|derivations]] at $p$, i.e., the [[Functions and Mappings|vector-valued function]] defined as
$$\begin{array}{rrcl}
\phi:&T_p(\mathbb{R}^n)&\to&\mathcal{D}_p(\mathbb{R}^n)\\
&v&\mapsto&D_v=D(p)v
\end{array}$$
is an [[isomorphism]] between vector spaces.
