# Analysis of Variance Test (ANOVA)

Tests whether the means of two or more independent samples are significantly different.

## Assumptions

- Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).
- Observations in each sample are normally distributed.
- Observations in each sample have the same variance.

## Hypothesis Formulation

- H0: the means of the samples are equal.
- H1: one or more of the means of the samples are unequal.

## Code Formulation

```python
# Example of the Analysis of Variance Test
from scipy.stats import f_oneway
data1 = [0.873, 2.817, 0.121, -0.945, -0.055, -1.436, 0.360, -1.478, -1.637, -1.869]
data2 = [1.142, -0.432, -0.938, -0.729, -0.846, -0.157, 0.500, 1.183, -1.075, -0.169]
data3 = [-0.208, 0.696, 0.928, -1.148, -0.213, 0.229, 0.137, 0.269, -0.870, -1.204]
stat, p = f_oneway(data1, data2, data3)
print('stat=%.3f, p=%.3f' % (stat, p))
if p > 0.05:
	print('Probably the same distribution')
else:
	print('Probably different distributions')
