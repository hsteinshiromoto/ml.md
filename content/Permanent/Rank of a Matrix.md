# Rank of a Matrix

## Statements

**Definition**. Let $A\in\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m$, the _rank_ of $A$ is equivalently defined in three ways
1. The dimension of the vector subspace $V^n$ spanned by the rows.
2. The dimension of the vector subspace $V^m$ spanned by the rows.
3. The maximum order of any nonvanishing minor determinant.
