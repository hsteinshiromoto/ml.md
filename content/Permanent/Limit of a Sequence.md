# Limit of a Sequence

## Context

## Statements

**Definition** ([[Mendelson, B. - Introduction to Topology|@Men90, Definition 5.1]], [[A Short Introduction to Metric Spaces|@Eck23, Definition 3.1]]). Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] , $\{x_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\subset X$ be a [[Sequence|sequence]]. A point $x$ is said to the _limit of the sequence_ $\{x_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ if, for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a positive integer $N>0$ such that, for every $n>N$, the inequality $d(x,x_n)<\varepsilon$ holds. It is also said that the sequence $\{x_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ _converges_ to $x$.

## Remark

A [[sequence]] is convergent if the terms of the [[sequence]] are getting closer and closer to some point $𝑥\in 𝑋$.
