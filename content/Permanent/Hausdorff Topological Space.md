# Hausdorff Topological Space

## Definition

**Definition**. A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is _Hausdorff_ if for every two distinct points $x,y\in X$, there exist disjoint [[Open Set|open sets]] $U,V\subseteq X$ such that $x\in U$ and $y\in V$. A Hausdorff space is _normal_ if given any two disjoint [[Closed Set|closed sets]] $F,G$ in $X$, there exist disjoint [[Open Set|open sets]] $U,V$ such that $F\subset U$ and $G\subset V$.
