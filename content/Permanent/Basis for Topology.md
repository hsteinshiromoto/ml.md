# Basis for Topology

## Statements

**Definition**. A _basis for the [[Topology|topology]]_ $\tau$ of a [[Topological Space|topological space]] $(X, \tau)$ is a family $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\tau$ of [[Open Set|open sets]] such that every [[Topological Open Set|open set]] of the [[Topology|topology]] can be represented as the union of some subfamily of $\mathcal{B}$.
