# Basis for Topology

## Definition

**Definition**. A _basis for the [[topology]]_ $\tau$ of a [[topological space]] $(X, \tau)$ is a family $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\tau$ of [[Open Set|open sets]] such that every [[open set]] of the [[topology]] can be represented as the union of some subfamily of $\mathcal{B}$.
