# Jacobian Matrix

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $F:X\to Y$ be a [[differentiable]] [[Functions and Mappings|vector-valued function]], the matrix
$$DF=\begin{pmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial f^1}{\partial x^1}&\cdots&\dfrac{\partial f^1}{\partial x^n}\\
\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
\dfrac{\partial f^m}{\partial x^1}&\cdots&\dfrac{\partial f^m}{\partial x^n}
\end{pmatrix}$$
is said to be the _Jacobian matrix_.
