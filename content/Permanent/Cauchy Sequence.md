# Cauchy Sequence

## Statements

**Definition** ([[A Short Introduction to Metric Spaces|@Eck23, Definition 5.1]]). Let be a $(X,d)$ be a [[Metric Space|metric space]]. A [[sequence]] $\{x_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\subset X$ is said to be a _Cauchy sequence_ if, for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists an integer $N>0$ such that if $n$ and $m$ are integers greater than or equal to $N$ then the inequality $d(x_n,x_m)<\varepsilon$ holds.

## Remark

A Cauchy sequence is a [[sequence]] where the terms of the sequence are getting closer and closer to each other.
