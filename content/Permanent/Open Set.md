# Open Set

## Context

There are two definitions for open sets. The first is based on a metric.

![[Metric Open Set#Statements]]

The second, is based on the concept of [[topological space]].

![[Topological Open Set#Statements]]

The following proposition shows that the metric-based definition implies the second.

## Statements

**Proposition**. Let $(X, d)$ be a [[metric space]] and $S\subseteq X$ be a [[metric open set]]. Then, $S$ is also a [[topological open set]].

_Proof_. From the [[topological space induced by the metric space]], [[Metric Open Set|metric open sets]] form a [[topology]] in $X$.

## Remark

A [[topological open set]] does not necessary implies a [[metric open set]].
