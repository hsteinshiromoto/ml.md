# Probability Measure

## Statements

**Definition**. Let ${\displaystyle (\Omega,{\mathcal {F}},P )}$ be a [[Measure Space|measure space]]. The [[Lebesgue Measure|measure]] $P:\mathcal{F}\to[0,1]$ is said to be a _probability measure_ if $P(\emptyset) = 0$ and $P(\Omega)=1$. When $P$ is a probability measure, the triple ${\displaystyle (\Omega,{\mathcal {F}},P )}$ is said to be a _probability triple_ or a _probability space_.
