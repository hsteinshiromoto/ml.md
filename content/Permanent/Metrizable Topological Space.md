# Metrizable Topological Space

## Definition

**Definition**. A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is said to be a _metrizable space_ if there exists a [[metric]] $d:X\times X\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$ such that the [[topology]] induced by $d$ is $\tau$. That is, a _metrizable space_ is a [[topological space]] [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[metric space]].
