# Rank of a Vector-Valued Function

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be an [[open set]] and $F:U\to\mathbb{R}^m$ be a [[Functions and Mappings|vector-valued function]] composed of [[Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphisms]]. Then, $DF(p)$ is said to have _rank_ $k$ at $p\in U$ if the [[Jacobian matrix]] has [[Rank of a Matrix|rank]] $k$.
