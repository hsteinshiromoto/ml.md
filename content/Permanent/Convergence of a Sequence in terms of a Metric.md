# Convergence of a Sequence in terms of a Metric

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]]. Let $\{a_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\subset X$ be a [[sequence]]. A point $a\in X$ is said to be the _limit of the_ [[sequence]]  $\{a_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ if $$\lim_{n\to\infty}d(a,a_n)=0\;.$$
In this case, the sequence is said to _converge_ to $a$ and this is denoted as $\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n=a$.

Note that the [[Induced Topology of a Metric]] implies that the [[Convergence of a Sequence in terms of Open Sets|convergence of a sequence can also be stated in terms of open sets]].
