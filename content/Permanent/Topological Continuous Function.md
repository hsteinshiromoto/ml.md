**Definition** ([[Tu, L. W. - An introduction to Manifolds|@Tu11 pp. 327]], [[Bourbaki, N. - General Topology Chapters 1-4|@Bou95, Chapter 2, Definition 1]]). Let $(X, \tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be [[Topological Space|topological spaces]]. A mapping $f:X\to Y$ is said to be _continuous at a point_ $x \in X$ if, for every [[topological neighborhood]] $N_Y$ of $f(x)\subset Y$, there exists a [[topological neighborhood]] $N_X$ of $x\in X$ such that the relation $x\in N_X$ implies $f(x)\in N_Y$. In addition, $f$ is _continuous on_ $X$ if it is continuous at every point of $X$.
