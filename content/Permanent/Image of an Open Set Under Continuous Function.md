# The Image of an Open Set Under Continuous Function

## Remark

**Remark**. Let $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be [[Topological Space|topological spaces]]. The image of an [[Open Set|open]] (resp. [[Closed Set|closed]]) set of a [[continuous function]] $f:X\to Y$ is not necessarily [[Open Set|open]] (resp. [[Closed Set|closed]]) in $Y$.
