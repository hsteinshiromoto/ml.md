## Statements

**Definition**. ([[Salsa S. - Partial Differential Equations in Action|@Sal08, Example B.1]], [[Hunter, J. K. -- Measure Theory|@Hun11]]) Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[Topological Space|topological space]]. The _Borel sigma algebra_ $\mathfrak{B}$ on $X$ is the [[Sigma Algebra|sigma algebra]] generated by the [[Open Set|open sets]] of $\tau$. The elements of $\mathfrak{B}$ are said to be _Borel sets_.

**Remark**. A _Borel set_ is any set in a [[Topological Space|topological space]] that can be formed from [[Open Set|open sets]] (or, equivalently, from [[Closed Set|closed sets]]) through the operations of countable union, countable countable intersection, and [relative complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_complement).
