# Tangent Vectors Are Derivations

## Statements

**Corollary**. Under the conditions of the Theorem [[Tangent Vectors as Derivations]], the canonical basis $\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$ for $T_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ corresponds to the set
$$\left\{\left.\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^1}\right|_p,\cdots,\left.\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\right|_p\right\}$$
of [[Partial Derivative|partial derivatives]]. Thus, for a function $f\in\mathcal{C}^\infty(p)$, the [[Directional Derivative|directional derivative]] of $f$ in the direction of the vector $v=v^1e_1+\cdots+v^ne_n$ of $T_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ at $p$ can be rewritten as
$$X_p^\ast f=\sum_{i=1}^nv^i\left.\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\right|_p\;.$$
