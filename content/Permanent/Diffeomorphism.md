# Diffeomorphism

## Statements

**Definition**. Let $r\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}$, $U$ and $V$ be [[Open Set|open sets]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$. A [[Functions and Mappings|vector-valued function]] $F:U\to V$ is said to be a _$\mathcal{C}^r-$diffeomorphism_ if
1. $F$ is a [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphism]].
2. $F$ and $F^{-1}$ are of [[Continous Differentiability|class]] $\mathcal{C}^r(U,V)$.
