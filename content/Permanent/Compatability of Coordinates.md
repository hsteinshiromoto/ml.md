# Compatibility of Coordinates

## Statements

**Definition**. The [[Coordinate Neighborhood|coordinate neighborhoods]] $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are said to be $\mathcal{C}^r-$_compatible_ if $U\cap V\neq\emptyset$ implies that there exists $r\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}$ such that, for indices $i,j\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}$, the functions $h^i$ and $g^j$ giving the change of [[Coordinate Neighborhood|coordinates]] are of [[Continous Differentiability|class]] $\mathcal{C}^r$. This is equivalent to requiring $\varphi\circ\psi^{-1}$ and $\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}$ to be [[Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphisms]] of the [[Open Set|open subsets]] $\varphi(U\cap V)$ and $\psi(U\cap V)$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
