# Interior Point and Interior of a Set

## Definition

 **Definition**. Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]], and $S\subset X$. An element $p\in S$ is said to be an _interior point of_ $S$ if there exists a [[neighborhood]] $N$ of $p$ such that $N\subset S$. The _interior of_ $S$ is the set of all interior points of $S$.
