# Coordinate Neighborhood

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $M$ be a [[topological manifold]],  $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ an [[open set]] and $\varphi:U\to\varphi(U)\subset M$ be a [[Locally Euclidean|parametrization]]. Define
- The inverse $\varphi^{-1}$ is as the _coordinate system_ or _chart_.
- The set $\varphi(U)\subset M$ as the _coordinate neighborhood_.
