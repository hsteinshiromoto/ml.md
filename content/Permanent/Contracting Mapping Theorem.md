# Contracting Mapping Theorem

## Theorem

**Theorem**. Let $(X,d)$ me a [[complete metric space]] and let $T:M\to M$. If there exists a constant $\lambda\in[0, 1)$ such that, for every $x_1,x_2\in X$ the inequality $$d(T(x_1),T(x_2))\leq\lambda d(x_1,x_2)$$ holds, then $T$ has a unique fixed point $a$ in $M$.
