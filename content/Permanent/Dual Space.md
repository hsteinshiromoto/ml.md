# Dual Space

## Statements

**Definition**. ([[Tu, L. W. - An introduction to Manifolds|L. W. Tu - An Introduction to Manifolds]]) Let $V$ and $W$ be real [[Vector Space|vector spaces]], the [[Vector Space|vector space]] composed of all linear maps $f:V\to W$ is denoted by Hom$(V,W)$. The _dual space_ $V^V$ of $V$ the is the space of all real-valued linear functions on $V$ $$V^V=\text{Hom}(V,\mathbb{R})\;.$$
The elements of $V^V$ said to be _covectors_ or _$1-$covectors_ on $V$.
