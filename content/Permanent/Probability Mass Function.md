# Probability Mass Function

[[Probability Measure|Probability]] mass functions are used to define the [[Probability Distribution|distributions]] of discrete random variables $X:\Omega\to\mathcal{X}$ with discrete and finite (or least countable) outcome set $\mathcal{X}$.

## Definition

Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ be a [[Probability Measure|probability]] space. A [[Random Variable]] $X:\Omega\to\mathcal{X}$ is said to be discrete, if its outcome space $\mathcal{X}$ contains countably many elements $x_i, i = 1,2,\ldots$. The _probability mass function_ (PMF) of a discrete [[Random Variable]] $X$ is denoted by $p_X$ and is defined as

$$p_X:\mathcal{X}\to[0,1]$$

$$ p_X(x_i)=P_X(X=x_i)$$
