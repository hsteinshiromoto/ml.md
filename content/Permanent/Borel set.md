# Borel Set

## Definition

**Definition**. A _Borel set_ is any set in a [[topological space]] that can be formed from [[Open Set|open sets]] (or, equivalently, from [[Closed Set|closed sets]]) through the operations of coutable union, countable countable intersection, and [relative complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_complement)
