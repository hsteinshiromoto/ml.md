# Measurable Function

## Definition

Let $(\Omega,\sigma)$ and ${\displaystyle (\Gamma,\tau )}$ be [[Measure Space|measurable spaces]], meaning that $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$ are sets equipped with respective [[Sigma Algebra|σ-algebras]] $\sigma$ and $\tau$. A function $f:\Omega\to \Gamma$ is said to be _measurable_ if, for every ${\displaystyle T\in \mathrm {\tau} }$ the pre-image of $T$ under $f$ is in $\sigma$. More precisely, for all ${\displaystyle T\in \tau }$

$${\displaystyle f^{-1}(T):=\{\omega\in \Omega\mid f(\omega)\in T\}\in \sigma .}$$

That is, ${\displaystyle \sigma (f)\subseteq \sigma ,}$ where ${\displaystyle \sigma (f)}$ is the [σ-algebra generated by f](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A3-algebra#σ-algebra_generated_by_a_function "Σ-algebra").

If $f:\Omega\to \Gamma$ is a measurable function, we will write

$${\displaystyle f\colon (\Omega,\sigma )\rightarrow (\Gamma,\tau ).}$$

to emphasize the dependency on the [[Sigma Algebra|σ-algebras]] $\Sigma$ and $T$.
