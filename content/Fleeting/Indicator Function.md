# Indicator Function

## Definition

Let $u\in\mathbb{R}$ be a constant value and consider the function $1_{x\geq u}:\mathbb{R}^n\to\{0,1\}$ defined, for every $x\in\mathbb{R}$, as

$$1_{x\geq u}\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
1,&x\geq u\\
0,&x< u\;.\\
\end{array}\right.$$
is called as _indicator function_.
