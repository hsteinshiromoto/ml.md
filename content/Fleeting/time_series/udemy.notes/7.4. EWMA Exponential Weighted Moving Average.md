* Exercise with the airline dataset

Formula
$$y(t)=\dfrac{\sum_{i=0}^t w_ix(t-i)}{\sum_{i=0}^t w_i}\;,$$
where $x(t)$ is the input value, $w_i$ is the applied weight and $y(t)$ is the output

How to decide on the values of $w_i$?

Adjust (from pandas) calculates the weights using two different formulae whether or not adjust is `true` ot not. The weights are parametrized by a value $\alpha$

Pandas sets $\alpha$ in three ways:
	* Span: corresponds to $N-day$ exponential moving average. This parametrizes $\alpha$ by a value $s\geq1$
	* Center of mass: has a more physical interpretation. This parametrizes $\alpha$ by a value $c=(s-1)/2$
	* Half-life: period of time for the exponential weight to reduct to one half. This parametrizes $\alpha$ by a value $h$.
