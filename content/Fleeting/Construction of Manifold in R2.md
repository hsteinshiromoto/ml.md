# Construction of Manifold in $\mathbb{R}^2$

## Example

**Example**. {[[Youtube - whybmaths]]} Construction of a manifold in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $(\mathbb{R}^2, \tau_{\mathbb{R}^2})$ be a [[Topological Space]] and let $\mathcal{A}=(U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha)$ an be [[Atlas 1]], where the coordinate chart is the the identity map.
