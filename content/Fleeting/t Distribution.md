# T Distribution

# T Distribution

## Definition

([@[[D. Ostwald - The general linear model 20_21|Ost20]]], Definition 7.5.1) Let $T$ be a [[random variable]] with outcome set $\mathbb{R}$ and [[Probability Density Function|PDF]]

$$f(x)=\dfrac{\Gamma((n+1)/2)}{\Gamma(n/2)\sqrt{\pi n}}\left(\dfrac{1}{1+t^2/n}\right)^{\frac{n+1}{2}},$$

Then $T$ is called a _t random variable_ and said to be distributed according to a _t distribution_ with $n$ degrees of freedom, for which we write $T\sim t(n)$.
