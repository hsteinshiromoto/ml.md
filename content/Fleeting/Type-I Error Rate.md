# [[Type-I Error]] Rate

## Definition

Let $\phi$ be a [[test]], the [[Probability Distribution|probability]] of a [[Type-I Error]] under a given probabilistic model is central to the quality of a [[Statistical Test|test]]. The [[Probability Distribution|probability]] of a [[Type-I Error]] is called the _size of the test_ and is denoted by $\alpha\in[0,1]$. It is defined as

$$\begin{equation}\tag{test size}\alpha:=p_{\Theta_0}(\phi(y)=1)\;,\end{equation}$$^testsize

and referred as _Type I error rate_ of the [[Statistical Test|test]]. Its complementary [[Probability Distribution|probability]]

$$p_{\Theta_0}(y=0)=1-\alpha$$

is known as the _specificity_ of the [[Statistical Test|test]].
