# Differential Entropy

Differential entropy is the continuous analog of Shannonâ€™s entropy. Let $X$ be a [[Random Variable|random variable]] with [[Probability Density Function|probability density function]] $p_X$, the _differential entropy_ is defined by the function
$$\begin{array}{rrcl}
h:&\mathbb{R}&\to&\mathbb{R}\\
  &x&\mapsto&-\displaystyle\int p_x(x)\log_2 p_X(x)\,dx,
\end{array}$$
where the integration is over the support of $p_X$.
