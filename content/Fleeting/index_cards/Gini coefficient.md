The Gini coefficient is a single number aimed at measuring the degree of inequality in a distribution. 

The coefficient values range from 0 (or 0%) to 1 (or 100%), with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality.

It is most often used in economics to measure how far a country's wealth or income distribution deviates from a totally equal distribution.

The graph shows that the Gini coefficient is equal to the area marked $A$ divided by the sum of the areas marked $A$ and $B$, that is, 

$$\text{Gini} = \dfrac{A}{A + B}\;.$$


It is also equal to $2A$ and to $1 âˆ’ 2B$ due to the fact that $A + B = 0.5$ (since the axes scale from 0 to 1).
