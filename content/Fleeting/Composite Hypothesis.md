# Simple or Composite Hypothesis

**Definition** ([[D. Ostwald - The general linear model 20_21|Ost20 pp.116]], Simple or Composite Hypothesis). Let $p_\theta(y)$ be a [[Parametric Probabilistic Model]]. A _simple hypothesis_ refers to a subset of parameter space which contains a single element, for example $\Theta_0 := {\theta_0}$. A _composite hypothesis_ refers to a subset of parameter space which contains more than one element, for example $\Theta_0 := \mathbb{R}_{\leq0}$.

The commonly encountered [[Statistical Test|null hypothesis]] $\Theta_0 = {0}$, also referred to as nil hypothesis, is an example for a simple hypothesis.
