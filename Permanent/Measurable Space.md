# Measurable Space

## Definition

**Definition**. A _measurable space_ $(X,\mathcal{X})$ is a set $X$, together with a collection $\mathcal{X}$ of subsets of $X$ which form a $\sigma-$[[Sigma Algebra|algebra]], thus $\mathcal{X}$ contains the empty set and $X$, and is closed under countable intersections, countable unions, and complements. A subset of $X$ is said to be measurable with respect to the measurable space if it lies in $\mathcal{X}$.
