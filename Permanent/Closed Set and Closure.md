# Closed Set and Closure

## Statements

**Proposition**. ([[Bourbaki, N. - General Topology Chapters 1-4|@Bou95, pp. 24]]) Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[Topological Space|topological space]], and $S\subseteq X$. Then,
1. $S$ is [[Closed Set|closed]] if and only if $\mathrm{cl}(S)=S$. In order words, $S$ is [[Closed Set|closed]] if and only if it is equal to is [[Closure of a Set|closure]].
2. The [[Closure of a Set|closure]] of $S$ is the smallest [[Closed Set|closed set]] that contains $S$.
