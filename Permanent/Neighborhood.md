# Neighborhood

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]], a set $N$ is said to be a _neighborhood_ of a point $p\in X$, denoted as $N(x)$ if there exists an [[open set]] $U$ of $X$ such that $p\in U\subseteq N\subseteq X$.

**Definition**. Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]]. A set $N\subset X$ is said to be a _neighborhood of_ $a\in X$ if there exists $\delta>0$ such that the [[open ball]] $B_{<\delta}(a)$ is a subset of $N$.
