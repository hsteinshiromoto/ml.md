# The Sequence lemma

## Proposition

**Proposition**. Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]] and $A$ a subset of $X$. If there exists a [[sequence]] $\{a_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ in $A$ that [[Convergence of a Sequence in terms of Open Sets|converges]] to $p\in A$, then $p \in cl(A)$. The converse is true if $X$ is [[First Countable]].
