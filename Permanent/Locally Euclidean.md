# Locally Euclidean

## Statements

**Definition**. ([[L. Godinho, J. Natario - An introduction to riemannian geometry|@GodNat14 pp. 8]], [[Boothby, W. M. - An introduction to differentiable manifolds and riemannian geometry|@Boo75 pp. 6]]) A [[Topological Space|topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is said to be _locally Euclidean of dimension_ $n$ if there exists $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that, for every $x\in X$, there exists a [[Neighborhood|neighborhood]] $N(x)$ that is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[Open Ball|open ball]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$ having dimension $n$. Such a homeomorphism is said to be a _parametrization_
