# Accumulation Point

## Context

## Statements

**Definition** ([[A Short Introduction to Metric Spaces|@Eck23, Definition 1.5]], [[Mendelson, B. - Introduction to Topology|@Men90, Defintion 6.6]]). Let $(X,d)$ be a [[metric space]] . A point $s\in S$ is said to be an _accumulation point of_ $S$ if, for every $\varepsilon>0$, the intersection of $S$ with the [[open ball]] $B_{<\varepsilon}(s)$ is non-empty, i.e., $S\cap B_{<\varepsilon}(s)\setminus \{s\})\neq\emptyset$.

## Remarks

The definition can also be restated in term of [[metric neighborhood]]: $s$ is an accumulation point if every neighborhood of $s$ contains a point of $S$ that is different from $s$.
