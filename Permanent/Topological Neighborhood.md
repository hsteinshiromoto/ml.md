**Definition** ([[Tu, L. W. - An introduction to Manifolds|@Tu11, pp. 318]]). Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]], a set $N$ is said to be a _neighborhood_ of a point $p\in X$, denoted as $N(x)$ if there exists an [[Topological Open Set|open set]] $U$ of $X$ such that $p\in U\subseteq N\subseteq X$.
