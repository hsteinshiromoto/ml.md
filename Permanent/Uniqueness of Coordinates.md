# Uniqueness of Coordinates

## Theorem

**Theorem**. Let the [[Differentiable Manifold|manifold]] $M$ be a [[Hausdorff Topological Space|hausdorff space]] with a [[countable basis of open sets]]. If $\mathscr{V}=\{V_\beta,\psi_\beta\}_{\beta\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a [[cover]] of $M$ by $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-[[Compatability of Coordinates|compatible coordinate neighborhoods]], then there exists a unique $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ structure on $M$ containing these [[Coordinate Neighborhood|coordinate neighborhoods]].
