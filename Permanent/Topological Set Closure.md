**Definition** ([[Bourbaki, N. - General Topology Chapters 1-4|@Bou95, Definition 10]]). Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]], and $S\subseteq X$. The _closure of_ $S$, denoted as $\mathrm{cl}(S)$, is the set of all elements $x\in X$ such that every [[topological neighborhood]] of $x$ meets $S$.
