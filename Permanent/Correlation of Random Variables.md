# Correlation of Random Variables

## Definition

([@][[D. Ostwald - The general linear model 20_21|Ost20]] Definition 6.4.1.) Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be [[Random Variable|random variables]] with [[Covariance of Random Variables|covariance]] $\texttt{Cov}(X_1,X_2)$ the _correlation_ of these variables is defined as
$$
\texttt{Corr}(X_{1},X_2)=\dfrac{\texttt{Cov}(X_{1},X_2)}{\texttt{Std}(X_1)S(X_2)}\;,
$$

where $\texttt{Std}$ is the [[Variance and Standard Deviation|standard deviation]].
