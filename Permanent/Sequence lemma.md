# Sequence Lemma

## Statements

**Lemma**. Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[Topological Space|topological space]] and $A$ a subset of $X$. If there exists a [[Sequence|sequence]] $\{a_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ in $A$ that [[Convergence of a Sequence in terms of Open Sets|converges]] to $p\in A$, then $p \in cl(A)$. The converse is true if $X$ is [[First Countable]].
