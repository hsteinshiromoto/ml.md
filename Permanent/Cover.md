# Cover

## Statements

**Definition**. Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[Topological Space|topological space]]. A collection $\{U\}_\alpha$ of [[Topological Open Set|open sets]] subsets of $X$ is said to _cover_ $X$ if
$$X\subseteq\bigcup_{\alpha}U_\alpha\;.$$
A _subcover_ of a cover is a subcollection whose union still contains $X$.
