# Continous Differentiability

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be an [[open set]]. Let $r\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}$, a function $f:U\to\mathbb{R}$ is said to be _$r-$continuously differentiable_ or _of class $\mathcal{C}^r$_ on $U$, denoted as $\mathcal{C}^r(U,\mathbb{R})$, if it has [[Continuous Function|continuous]] [[Partial Derivative|derivatives]] of order 1, 2, ..., $r$ on $U$. If $r=\infty$, then is said to be _smooth_.
