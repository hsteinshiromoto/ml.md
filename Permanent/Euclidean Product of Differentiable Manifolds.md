# Euclidean Product of Differentiable Manifolds

## Theorem

**Theorem**. Let $M$ and $N$ be [[Differentiable Manifold|smooth manifolds]] with dimensions $m$ and $n$. THen $M\times N$ is a [[Differentiable Manifold|smooth manifold]] with a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ structure determined by [[Coordinate Neighborhood|coordinate neighborhood]] of the form $\{U\times V,\varphi\times\psi\}$, where $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are [[Coordinate Neighborhood|coordinate neighborhoods]] on $M$ and $N$, respectively, and $\varphi\times\psi:\mathbb{R}^m\times\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$.
