# Continuity in terms of Preimage

## Proposition

**Proposition**. Let $(X, \tau_x)$ and $(Y, \tau_y)$ be [[Topological Space|topological spaces]]. A function $f:X\to Y$ is [[Continuous Function|continuous]] if and only if, for every [[open set]] $V\subset Y$, the [[Preimage]]  of $V$ under $f$ is an [[open set]] of $X$.
