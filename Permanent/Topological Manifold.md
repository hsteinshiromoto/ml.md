# Topological Manifold

## Definition

**Definition**. A _manifold $M$ of dimension $n$_ is a [[topological space]] with the following properties:
1. $M$ is [[Hausdorff Topological Space|Hausdorff]]. This ensures that the [[Uniqueness of the Limit|limit of a convergent sequence is unique]].
2. $M$ is [[locally Euclidean]] of dimension $n$.
3. $M$ has a countable [[Basis for Topology|basis]] of [[Open Set|open sets]]. The countable basis ensures the existence of [[Partition of Unity|partitions of unity]].
