# Topological Manifold

## Statements

**Definition**. ([[L. Godinho, J. Natario - An introduction to riemannian geometry|@GodNat14, pp. 2]], [[Boothby, W. M. - An introduction to differentiable manifolds and riemannian geometry|@Boo75 Definition 3.1]]) A _manifold $M$ of dimension $n$_ is a [[Topological Space|topological space]] with the following properties:
1. $M$ is [[Hausdorff Topological Space|Hausdorff]]. This ensures that the [[Uniqueness of the Limit|limit of a convergent sequence is unique]].
2. $M$ is [[Locally Euclidean|locally Euclidean]] of dimension $n$.
3. $M$ has a countable [[Basis for Topology|basis]] of [[Open Set|open sets]]. The countable basis ensures the existence of [[Partition of Unity|partitions of unity]].
