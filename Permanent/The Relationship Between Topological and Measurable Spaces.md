# The Relationship Between Topological and Measurable Spaces

## Remark

**Remark**. The notion of a [[measurable space]] $(X, \mathcal{X})$ (and of a [[measurable function]]) is superficially similar to that of a [[topological space]] $(X, \tau)$ (and of a [[continuous function]]); the [[topology]] $\tau$ contains $\emptyset$ and $X$ just as the [[Sigma Algebra|σ-algebra]] $\mathcal{X}$ does, but is now closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections, rather than countable unions, countable intersections, and complements. The two spaces are linked to each other by the [[Borel Sigma Algebra|Borel σ-algebra]]  construction.
