# Orientation

## Statements

**Definition**. ([[Citation Needed]]) Let $\nu$ be an [[1-form]] on $T_p\mathbb{R}^m$, where $p\in M\subset\mathbb{R}^m$. We say that the [[Differentiable Manifold|manifold]] $M$ is negatively (resp. positively) oriented if the value of
$$\nu\left(\dfrac{\partial\phi}{\partial x_1}(x_1,\ldots,x_n),\ldots,\dfrac{\partial\phi}{\partial x_n}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\right)$$
is negative (resp. positive), where $\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=p$.

 An orientation is precisely some piece of information about a [[Manifold]] $M$ which we can use to understand what should be sign of the [[Integration Of Differential Forms]].
