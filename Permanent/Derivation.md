# Derivation

## Statements

**Definition**. Let $v$ be a [[Euclidean Tangent Space|tangent vector]] at a point $p\in\mathbb{R}^n$, the mapping $D_v:\mathcal{C}^\infty(p)\to\mathbb{R}$ defined by the [[Directional Derivative|directional derivative]] at $p$ is said to be a _derivation at_ $p$. The set of all derivations at $p$ is denoted as $\mathcal{D}_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$.
