## Theorem

**Theorem**. Let $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ and $V\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ be [[Open Set|open sets]], $F:U\to V$ be a [[Functions and Mappings|vector-valued function]] [[differentiable]] at $a\in U$ and $G:V\to\mathbb{R}^p$ be a [[Functions and Mappings|vector-valued function]] [[differentiable]] at $b=F(a)\in V$. Then, $H=G\circ F$ is [[differentiable]] at $x=a$ and we have
$$DH(a)=DG(F(a))DF(a)\;.$$
