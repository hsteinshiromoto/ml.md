# Repeated Measures ANOVA Test

Tests whether the means of two or more paired samples are significantly different.

## Assumptions

- Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).
- Observations in each sample are normally distributed.
- Observations in each sample have the same variance.
- Observations across each sample are paired.

## Hypothesis Formulation

- H0: the means of the samples are equal.
- H1: one or more of the means of the samples are unequal.

## Code Implementation

- Not supported in Python.
