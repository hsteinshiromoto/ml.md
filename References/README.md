## What Are Reference Notes?

Reference notes are the original text that resonated with you. Other than being useful for citation, capturing them can also give context to what you were thinking, should you return to your notes at a later time. Capture the whole paragraph but highlight the sentence that resonates to capture the entire idea in essence and give context to the highlight.
