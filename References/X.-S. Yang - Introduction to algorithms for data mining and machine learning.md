# Introduction to algorithms for data mining and machine learning

Introduction to Algorithms for Data Mining and Machine Learning introduces the essential ideas behind all key algorithms and techniques for data mining and machine learning, along with optimization techniques. Its strong formal mathematical approach, well selected examples, and practical software recommendations help readers develop confidence in their data modeling skills so they can process and interpret data for classification, clustering, curve-fitting and predictions. Masterfully balancing theory and practice, it is especially useful for those who need relevant, well explained, but not rigorous (proofs based) background theory and clear guidelines for working with big data. Key Features Presents an informal, theorem-free approach with concise, compact coverage of all fundamental topics Includes worked examples that help users increase confidence in their understanding of key algorithms, thus encouraging self-study Provides algorithms and techniques that can be implemented in any programming language, with each chapter including notes about relevant software packages # Table of Contents 1 - Introduction to optimization 2 - Mathematical foundations 3 - Optimization algorithms 4 - Data fitting and regression 5 - Logistic regression, PCA, LDA, and ICA 6 - Data mining techniques 7 - Support vector machine and regression 8 - Neural networks and deep learning
